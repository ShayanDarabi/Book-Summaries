    "In the final part of the project, which involves converting the book summary into an image, I found a text-to-image model on Hugging Face ðŸ¤— called [`stable-diffusion`](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0?text=The+book+follows+the+journey+of+an+Anabaptist+radical+across+Europe+in+the+first+half+of+the+16th+century+as+he+joins+in+various+movements+and+uprisings+that+come+as+a+result+of+the+Protestant+reformation.+The+book+spans+30+years+as+he+is+pursued+by+%5C%27Q%5C%27+%28short+for+%22Qo%C3%A8let%22%29%2C+a+spy+for+the+Roman+Catholic+Church+cardinal+Giovanni+Pietro+Carafa.+The+main+character%2C+who+changes+his+name+many+times+during+the+story%2C+first+fights+in+the+German+Peasants%5C%27+War+beside+Thomas+M%C3%BCntzer%2C+then+is+in+M%C3%BCnster%5C%27s+siege%2C+during+the+M%C3%BCnster+Rebellion%2C+and+some+years+later%2C+in+Venice.).Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released from [`Stability AI`](https://stability.ai/) in 2022 based on diffusion techniques. It is considered to be a part of the ongoing artifical intelligence boom. However, due to lack of memory, I was compelled to use the [`Clipdrop`](https://clipdrop.co/apis/docs/text-to-image) website's API, which allowed me to make 100 requests for free. Using together.ai and the Llama language model, I compressed the book summary and then passed the compressed summary through Clipdrop to stable-diffusion to generate an image of the book summary. You are welcome to see the first generated image :)\n",
